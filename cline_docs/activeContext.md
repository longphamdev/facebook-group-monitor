# Active Context

## What I'm Currently Working On
I am currently working on understanding the project structure and functionality to create the Memory Bank files.

## Recent Changes
- Read and analyzed all project files.
- Summarized the project's purpose and components.

## Next Steps
- Create the remaining Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Ensure all files are correctly populated with relevant information.
